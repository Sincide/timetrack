# Future Plan

This roadmap outlines potential enhancements and larger goals for the Timetrack project.

## Short Term
- Dockerize the application for straightforward deployment on Hetzner servers.
- Add more unit tests covering error conditions and CSV export.
- Improve handling of partial days and negative time adjustments.

## Medium Term
- Introduce user authentication and per-user time logs.
- Support tagging entries with projects or tasks for better reporting.
- Provide a simple web dashboard using FastAPI templates or a lightweight frontend.

## Long Term
- Implement role-based access control for team management.
- Expose REST and optional GraphQL APIs.
- Integrate with external calendar systems for automatic time tracking.

These plans are aspirational and may evolve based on project needs and user feedback.
